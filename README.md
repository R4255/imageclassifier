I've developed an image classifier machine learning application deployed on Flask, a popular Python web framework. This application allows users to upload images and receive predictions about the contents of those images based on a pre-trained machine learning model.

The application's backend utilizes Flask to handle incoming HTTP requests, process uploaded images, and interface with the machine learning model.
